Introduction
Welcome to the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) project using the IBM Model 1! This README serves as a guide to understanding the project, its components, and how to utilize it effectively.

Overview
The IBM Model 1 is a foundational statistical model used in machine translation. It aims to learn word alignment probabilities from a parallel corpus (text in two languages) without considering word order or context. This model is a fundamental building block in statistical machine translation systems.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Training Data: Parallel corpus containing text in source and target languages.
IBM Model 1 Implementation: Code implementing the IBM Model 1 algorithm.
Evaluation Scripts: Scripts to evaluate the performance of the translation using metrics like BLEU score.
Documentation: Additional documentation explaining the codebase, algorithms, and usage instructions.
Requirements
To run this project, you need:

Python (version X.X or higher)
NumPy library
(Optional) NLTK library for text processing
Usage
Data Preparation:
Ensure you have a parallel corpus in your source and target languages.
Preprocess the data by tokenizing and cleaning it if necessary.
Training:
Run the IBM Model 1 implementation on your parallel corpus.
Adjust any hyperparameters as needed, such as the number of iterations.
Translation:
Given a sentence in the source language, use the trained model to generate the corresponding translation in the target language.
Evaluation:
Use evaluation scripts to measure the quality of translations, typically using metrics like BLEU score.
